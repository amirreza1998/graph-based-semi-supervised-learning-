# graph-based-semi-supervised-learning-
this repository implements the method that published in paper by name of "A simple graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for imbalanced classification" by "Jianjin Deng"  and  "Jin-Gang Yu"
<br />
⚡️at "simple-graph-based-semi-supervised-learning-approach.ipynb" i explain all function and process of code and blocks and run code on half moon that created in code 
<br />
⚡️at "two-circle-simple-graph-based-semi-supervised-learning-approach.ipynb" run same code of "simple-graph-based-semi-supervised-learning-approach.ipynb" but with 2 circle code that you could change ration of sample from two class with ration value
